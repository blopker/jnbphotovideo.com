##The photography portfolio for the Lazy Photographer.

The goal of this site it to make a cross-browser static site that does not require the maintainer to know anything about web sites. Namely, updating the siteâ€™s content ishandled by adding new photos to Flickr with the appropriate tags.

##Setup
To setup make sure you have a working Jekyll install. Then run:

>cd jnbphotovideo.com
>
>Jekyll

The sites files will compile into the _site directory.
